    <h4>3130 Assignment 4 - Aswin Nair</h4>
    <!-- Info -->
    <div>
      <h5 align="left">Info:</h5>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
        This website was made for the fourth assignment in my data structures
        course at Brooklyn College. Its intention is to visualize data that was
        produced from my previous assignment in the same class. In that
        assignment, I created a Java program that took an input file with song
        lyrics which then generated a frequency list of the words in the file. I
        used that final output file to create this word cloud presentation to
        better visualize the data.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- Under The Hood -->
    <div>
      <h5 align="left">Under The Hood:</h5>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
        The application was written in Java, using the HashMap data structure in
        Java to store the words from the input.
      </p>
      <ul align="left">
        <li>
          First, the words from the input file are taken, accounting for their
          case and unneeded punctuation.
        </li>
        <li>
          Then, the words are added one-by-one to a HashMap with their
          respective frequencies changing through every iteration.
        </li>
        <li>It is then sorted from highest to lowest frequency.</li>
        <li>
          Finally, the words and their frequencies are outputted into a new
          file.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p style="text-align: justify">
        The reason the HashMap was used in this case was because of its
        simplicity of key-value pairs and its relevance to the problem. The
        frequency list needs to have two things: words and its frequency.
        Therefore, it is easy to see why a HashMap would best solve the problem.
        However, HashMaps make no guarantee as to the order of the map. As such,
        a function was created to sort the values from highest to lowest using
        the available sort method in the Java Collections class.
      </p>

      <!-- Code snippet -->
      <p style="text-align: justify">
        The output for the file should look like:
      </p>
      <div class="rounded" style="background-color: #f6f8fa;">
        <p class="pl-3 pt-2 pb-2" align="left">
          31: the <br />
          21: i <br />18: and
        </p>
      </div>
      <p style="text-align: justify">
        and so on.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- Visualization and Music -->
    <div>
      <h5 align="left">Visualization and Music:</h5>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
        For this project, I chose this word cloud as the method of data
        visualization because it is rather simple to view and understand. The
        words grow larger according to its frequency and the shape of the data
        is a record to represent music (and because I thought it looked cool).
        If given more time, I would've liked to have used a JavaScript based
        data visualization library such as <a href="https://d3js.org">D3.JS</a>.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
        The song I chose for this project is called "44 Bars" by Logic. Logic
        has been one of my favorite artists for a long time now and since this
        song is one of my favorites, I thought it was only appropriate.
        Furthermore, it would be rather interesting to see how his songs compare
        to one another so I would've liked to do a few more frequency lists if
        allowed. The album that included this song named "Bobby Tarantino" was
        released in 2016 and actually was his second album to be No. 1 on the
        Billboard 200 Chart. Unsurprisingly, "people" was one of the most common
        words in the song and was used to express his appreciation for all
        people no matter what their background.

      <h5 align="left">Conclusion:</h5>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
        The project was actually pretty fun to work on because we finally had
        the opportunity to work with web languages instead of the usual Java
        routine. I enjoyed learning about the world of data structures and what
        they have to offer in the various fields in computer science as well as
        doing projects such as this that are more hands-on.
